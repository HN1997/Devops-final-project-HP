## 1 - List of all the work performed

1. Create a web application 
* Everything works: you have a user API with redis where you can do CRUD operations. 

2. Apply CI/CD pipeline
* We have used Tracis CI which is building successfully our app (.travis.yml)
* We have used Heroku which deploys our app (and put the reference in .travis.yml).

## 2 - Instructions

* Clone this repository, from your local machine:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/HN1997/Devops-Project.git 
  cd Devops-Projet
  cd RedisApp
  ```
* Install packages and run the app
  ```
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
  And open your browser and search for: http://localhost:3000.
  *Put description of the application, how to use it*
